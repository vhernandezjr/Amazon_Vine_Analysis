# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
ETL Big Data with Amazon

## Objectives
Use the cloud ETL process to create an AWS RDS database with tables in pgAdmin using a video game dataset from the Amazon Review datasets. From there extract the video game dataset into a DataFrame. Next the new DataFrame will be transformed into four separate DataFrames that match the table schema in pgAdmin. Lastley upload the transformed data into the appropriate tables and run queries in pgAdmin to confirm that the data has been uploaded.

Use PySpark to determine if there is any bias towards reviews that were written as part of the Vine program. Determine if having a paid Vine review makes a difference in the percentage of 5-star reviews.

## Video Games

Paid Vine isnâ€™t helpful for video game reviews, this demographic seems to bypass Vine altogether.
